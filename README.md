# Andrew's Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Hello and Welcome to the sixth project in my Udacity Front-end Nano Degree.

In this project I optimized this project site to reach a PageSpeed score of over 92 and optimized the javascript to run at 60fps by reducing rendering thrashing caused by forced synchronous layouts.

To view the site, click the following link: https://andrewjc88.github.io/Andrew-s-frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/

## Optimizations Made
* Minify critical css for all pages and embedded in to html files.
* Optimized Critical Rendering Patch by putting all render blocking css and javascript at the end of html file.
* Optimized images to increase page load performance.
* Refactored JavaScript to eliminate Jank caused by forced synchronous layouts.

## To Do
The background animations on the pizza.html site don't seem to be supported in chrome anymore. I was able to view them and optimize this site using Safari Developer Edition. (Reviewer, please advise!)
